# Historia
Historia is a special kind of language to express branching stories for games in the spirit of "Life is Strange" or "Detroit: Become Human". From the imperative code the Historia compiler generates a state machine in the form of a C# class. For more info on the language and the compiler look into the `docs` folder. Examples will later be added in the `examples` folder.
